Dystopia
========

This is a WebGL game I made during lessons in Game Design. For an assignment you had to add certain dynamics. Also see http://arcomul.nl/games/dytopia/info for more information. Or play the game at http://arcomul.nl/games/dystopia

Feel free to check/use/change the code and the models.

(Actually this is just an easy way to host my code, since I should be downloadable :-D)
